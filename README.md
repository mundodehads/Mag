Article Abstract
-------

The evaluation is an important component in the teaching and learning processes, providing a follow-up of the same, a learning assessment needs different evaluation tools so that in addition to measuring the knowledge of the evaluated one can diagnose its evolution. Educational environments use elements of games, such as earning points for performing tasks among others, however, the current system is flawed in engaging the student, thus creating a need for strategies to engage the learning process in education. Gamification uses the elements of gaming in the concept of non-gaming, and its study and application provide, in addition to the benefits of its elements, a synchrony and meaning for the application of the same for the purpose of engaging users and solving problems. This work proposes the use of gamification to elaborate a methodology of learning assessment as an evaluation instrument, aiming the evaluator as reflective agent to conclude it as an alternative methodology for evaluators in higher education. Results obtained when applying the generated methodology were positive, it was possible to notice the increase in the conclusion of activities, lower rate of evasion and greater satisfaction with the evaluator, creating a stronger link between evaluated and evaluator.
